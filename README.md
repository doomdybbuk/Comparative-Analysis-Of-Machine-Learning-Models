## Introduction

Bicycle accidents pose a significant concern in traffic safety. This project aims to predict bicycle accidents in Great Britain using machine learning techniques, with a focus on neural networks. Target encoding is employed as a preprocessing technique to enhance the model's predictive power.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle: [Bicycle Accidents in Great Britain 1979 to 2018](https://www.kaggle.com/your-username/bicycle-accidents-in-great-britain-1979-to-2018). It contains information about various factors related to bicycle accidents, including the number of vehicles involved, speed limits, road conditions, weather conditions, road types, and light conditions.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/github/Comparative-Analysis-Of-Machine-Learning-Models.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd your-repo-name
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Ensure you have downloaded the dataset from Kaggle and placed it in the project directory (as bicycle_accidents.csv).

Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to preprocess the data and train the neural network model.

Experiment with different hyperparameters, model architectures, and preprocessing techniques as needed.

Preprocessing
The preprocessing steps include:

Target encoding of categorical features.
Feature scaling or normalization.
Handling missing data.
Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Model Training
A neural network model is trained to predict bicycle accidents. The model architecture can be modified based on your requirements.

Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy and other relevant metrics. Experiment with different preprocessing techniques and hyperparameters to improve the model's performance.
